# ultimate windows ui fixer
a really poorly made shitpost batch script that ""fixes"" windows 10/11's ui 

# awesome WARNING!
when installing this, the script will start everything you boot up windows, if you dont want this uninstall the script

also i dont know if this can somehow break your pc for some ungodly reason so if that happens, oops!

# installing
extract everything into a folder somewhere and run install.bat as admin

# uninstalling
run uninstall.bat

# credits
7-zip for being the file archiver i bundled this tool with so you can use "7za" at any time to actually extract zip files
